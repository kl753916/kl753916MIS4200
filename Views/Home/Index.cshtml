        <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></p>
        <p> Some of the items that I changed for SD3 are: added this dropdown below, made the cob.ohio.edu button another color using bootstrap, added restrictions for when you make a new course, changed course details to have Full Name, made a table in the students tab, changed the delete pages heading to danger, and a few other things.</p>

        <button class="btn btn-success dropdown-toggle" type="button" data-toggle="dropdown">
            SD3
